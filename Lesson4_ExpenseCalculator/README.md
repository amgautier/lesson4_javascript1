### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Everything I learned in this lesson was brand new information to me. I leaned that while HTML is for creating static pages, 
    Javascript allows for more interaction between the webpage and the user. I also learned that it is the most popular scripting 
    language on the internet.
2. Javascriptis embedded directly into pages and can be used by anyone without a having to purchase a license. Javascript helps
    to improve the appearance of webpages, especially graphics.
3. A big lesson I learned is that Java is not the same thing as Javascript. Java programs are compiled and can be run as stand 
    alone applications. Javascript programs are interpreted in the browser.
